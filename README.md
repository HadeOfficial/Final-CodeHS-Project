The really freakin annoying CodeHS alternative because I hate codehs and what it stands for

<h1> SEMESTER END PROJECT. ADVANCED HTML AND CSS. </h1>
This entire page can be copied into your sandbox if you prefer.
Below this section is the code framework you were given for the
first project you created, "Homepage". I have included it in case you
need any of it for revision, or if it was missing from the original
assignment. For those that missed something in the first
assignment, I will give you points for completing it now. For those
that fully completed the previous assignment, you will automatically
receive those points. The following is what I want to see added to
your original "Homepage" assignment.

1. 15 points - Add a style.css page. Move your styles from the
"Homepage" to the style.css page and add any new styles to the
style.css page as well.

<ul>1 is done</ul>

2. 20 points - Have a total of 2 HTML pages. Make sure both
are connected to one another via links. Both pages should look
similar in style. As for what that second page contains, I will leave it
100% up to you. Maybe separate out an "About Me" page, or a
"Hobbies" page, include at least one photo and a paragraph,
minimum 4 sentences, describing what that page is about (could be
an ordered or unordered list if you prefer).

<ul>2 is done</ul>

3. 15 points - In the previous assignment you created a table. I
now want that table to have at least TWO background colors.

<ul> 3 is done</ul>

4. 15 points - Add a piece of text somewhere on one HTML
page that only shows up when you hover over it. When you submit
the assignment, please let me know where to find it.

5. 15 points - All images should be 200px X 200px or 300px X
300px and have some sort of border. I don't care about the border
style or color.

<ul>5 is done</ul>

6. 15 points- Add an animation of your choice to one photo.
Think filter, size change,
gray-scale or color change, etc.

<ul>6 is done</ul>

7. 10 points - All sections from the previous assignment
completed some of you will just recieve these for having this done
already. The rest can earn them back.
