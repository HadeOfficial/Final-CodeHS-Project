            <h4>
                This webpage is using Javascript to draw an image based canvas that's split 50:50 on startup with two randomly generated colors.
                Using math to determine randomness, adjacent tiles to any given tile of a color changes its color to the alternate color.
                Using this, it creates a canvas that is very unlikely to ever appear again, with a 1 in at least 6.7544576Ã—10<sup>75115</sup> possible positions.
                Also this is for the fourth sentence, but if you hover over the canvas it'll make some text appear.
            </h4>
            <h6> 
                There are 250000 tiles on this board, all can exist in 2 states, on or off, which means there's 2^250,000 positions available here
                For context, that number is a number that has 75,365 digits.
